# PeerVerse - Issues Fixed

## Summary of 4 Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Mobile Video Zoom Issue Fixed
**Problem**: When users joined meetings from mobile, their video appeared zoomed/cropped to other users.

**Solution**:
- Updated CSS `object-fit` from `contain` to `cover` for proper mobile video scaling
- Added mobile-specific viewport constraints with `max-width: 100vw` and `max-height: 100vh`
- Fixed responsive design for mobile devices with proper positioning
- Enhanced mobile controls layout and sizing

**Files Modified**:
- `FRONTEND/frontone/src/components/VideoCall.css` - Mobile responsive fixes
- Video elements now properly scale on mobile devices

### 2. ✅ Camera/Microphone Connection Issues Fixed
**Problem**: Meeting wouldn't connect if camera or microphone had problems, unlike Google Meet which asks users if they want to proceed.

**Solution**:
- Added graceful media permission handling with user-friendly dialog
- Implemented Google Meet-style permission flow: "Allow Access" or "Join Without Media"
- Added error handling for camera/mic failures with fallback options
- Users can now join meetings even if media devices fail
- Added visual indicators for media device status

**Files Modified**:
- `FRONTEND/frontone/src/components/VideoCall.js` - Added permission dialog and error handling
- `FRONTEND/frontone/src/components/VideoCall.css` - Added permission dialog styles

**New Features**:
- Media permission dialog with clear options
- Graceful fallback when devices are unavailable
- Visual error indicators for failed media access
- User can proceed with meeting even without camera/mic

### 3. ✅ Chat Window Issues Fixed
**Problem**: Messages appeared twice and message text was white (not visible).

**Solution**:
- Fixed socket.io message duplication by preventing local user messages from being added twice
- Added message deduplication logic to prevent duplicate messages
- Fixed chat message colors for better visibility:
  - Changed message text color from white to `#ffffff` with proper contrast
  - Updated username color to `#ffffff`
  - Improved timestamp color to `#cccccc` for better readability

**Files Modified**:
- `FRONTEND/frontone/src/components/VideoCall.js` - Fixed message duplication logic
- `FRONTEND/frontone/src/components/VideoCall.css` - Fixed chat message colors

### 4. ✅ OTP Signup/Forgot Password Issues Fixed
**Problem**: Signup and forgot password OTP emails were failing to send.

**Solution**:
- Completely rebuilt the backend API endpoints for proper OTP functionality
- Added Mailjet email service integration with retry mechanism
- Implemented proper database OTP storage and verification
- Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Created dedicated ForgotPassword component with 2-step flow

**Files Modified**:
- `BACKEND/api/index.js` - Complete rewrite with proper OTP functionality
- `FRONTEND/frontone/src/components/Signup.js` - Enhanced error handling
- `FRONTEND/frontone/src/components/Login.js` - Integrated forgot password flow
